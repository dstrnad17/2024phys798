Experiment 1

1. For each satellite, create a table like Erik's GOES_8.md. Add a row that is linear regression result when all inputs used.
2. For each satellite, plot predicted Bx, By, Bz vs measured

Discuss different architectures that were tried. Ideally only a few give poor results and others give similar results.

Experiment 2

Take prediction error for Bx for a satellite and 

y-axis is cc
x axis is r

split prediction error into 10 bins for r values. And compute cc in each bin.

Experiment 3

What influences predictability the most?
